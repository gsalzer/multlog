MUltlog & iLC
=============

MUltlog is a system which takes as input the specification of
a finitely-valued first-order logic and produces a sequent 
calculus, a tableaux calculus, a natural deduction system,
and clause formation rules for this logic. All generated
rules are optimized regarding their branching degree.
The output is in the form of a scientific paper written in LaTeX.

iLC is an editor for Tcl/Tk, which allows the user to specify many-valued
logics for MUltlog in a convenient form.

and example output PDFs is available at
