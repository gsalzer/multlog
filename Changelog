Changes to MUltlog:

1.14, 09.05.2021
- Bug fix regarding mins and maxs in ml_check.pl.
- Caching of minimization that may be computationally expensive.
- Appendix with specification of logic added to paper.
- \thanks includes citation info.
- Date set to date of conversion run by ml_tex.pl.
- Allow arbitrary TeX macros in .cfg; load \Preamble, \Intro, and
  \Semantics if defined.
- Add webpage/ to make the webpage at logic.at/multlog.
- Add an actual manual (doc/multlog.md & .tex).
1.13, 03.05.2021
- Make ml_tex.pl also produce code for tableaux.
- Update ml.tex: more current introduction, use modern packages, load
  hyperref, updated bibliography with links, add section on tableaux,
  add detail on completeness results and resolution.
- Update dialog text of iLC.
- Increase limit on name of logic to 40 chars.
1.12, 20.10.2020:
- Update the install script to install into ~/.local if not run as root, and 
  to put documentation into /usr/share/doc by default. Update README to reflect
  what's changed in the world in the last 20 years. Remove a bad character that
  caused a compile error from ml.bib (rzach)
1.11, 4.12.2014:
- "set_prolog_flag(double_quotes, codes)" added to ml_tex.pl, ml_lgc.pl
  and ml_check.pl. Necessary for SWI-Prolog version 7 and higher since
  now quoted strings no longer are code lists. Other Prolog systems
  or older versions of SWI-Prolog might complain about this directive.

1.10, 11.7.2001:
- Bug fix in ml_compactrepr.pl that made 1.09 unusable.
- Bug fix in installation script regarding lgc2pdf
- Installation/Deinstallation scripts changed
1.09:
- New implementation of propositional minimization routines.
- Script "lgc2pdf" added for direct generation of PDF paper.
1.08:
- Minimization of operators (propres.pl) replaced by a more stable
  algorithm (hopefully).
1.07:
- Bug: Operators defined as supremum or infimum wrt. an ordering
  were always assumed to be binary, regardless of the specified arity
  (reported by Chris Fermueller).
1.06:
- installation script improved: support for adding Prolog options,
  version number and date in separate file "Version"
- deinstallation script added

Changes to iLC:
1.2, 03.05.2021:
- Fixed some strings
1.1:
- Version number appears in the about-box
- iLC now preserves the order in which items are read from 
  an old specification and also allows you to determine 
  the order in which they will appear in the final result.
- improved help on: "why is my operator/quantifier/... not correct ?"
  (focus and cursor placement on the erroneous part)
- choosing "table" as type of operator now automatically
  sets arity to 2 (unless something else is already specified)
- a few more user-configurable options in config.tcl
- currently unavailable GUI-elements are now properly grayed out
- fixed _ALL_ the bugs ;-)
